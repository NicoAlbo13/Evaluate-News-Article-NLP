# Natural language processing (NLP)

NLP is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Goal

The goal of the project is to make an application that is able to analyze a text provided by the user and offer information about it, regarding the Agreement, Irony, Subjectivity and Confidence of the text. This is information is provided by the MeaningCloud API.

## How to start the app?

1. Start the server `npm run start`
2. Run `npm run build-dev` or `npm run build-prod`

## Test the app

1. Choose any type of text, or even your own text.
2. Paste the text you selected in the input area.
3. Look at the results.
